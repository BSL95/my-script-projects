# Practice Scripts (Python & PowerShell)

This repository contains a collection of practice scripts I’ve written while learning **Python** and **PowerShell**.  
The scripts are small experiments to help me explore different concepts, such as:

- 📊 **System Information (Python)** – exporting Windows system info and emailing it.  
- 🌐 **Networking Tasks (Python)** – logging timestamps, fetching public IP, running `ipconfig`, and ping tests.  
- 🔑 **Random Password Generator (PowerShell)** – creating strong random passwords.

  I will be adding more scripts overtime for different things and make improvments overtime to each of my scripts. 

## 🛠 Usage
- Run Python scripts with:
  ```bash
  python script_name.py

- Run Powershell
  ./script_name.ps1
