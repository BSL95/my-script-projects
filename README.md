## Practice Scripts & Docker Projects 

This repository is a collection of practice work I’m doing while learning **Python**, **PowerShell**, and **Docker**.  
It includes small experiments, automation tasks, and containerized projects.

## 📂 Contents

### 🐍 Python Scripts
- **System Info Exporter** – collects Windows system information and emails it.
- **Networking Tools** – logs timestamps, fetches public IP, runs `ipconfig`, and pings external hosts.

### 💻 PowerShell Scripts
- **Random Password Generator** – creates strong random passwords for practice and testing.

### 🐳 Docker Projects
- **Service Containers** – experimenting with services like Nginx, Vaultwarden, Gitea, Netdata, OpenWeb, Watchtower, RSS, and Dozzle.  
- **docker-compose.yml** – used to define and manage multi-container setups.  
These projects help me learn **containerization, orchestration, and self-hosting tools**.
